Since shuhari is a Japanese martial arts concept about learning stages, here are some creative naming approaches that could work well:

## Japanese-Inspired Path Names
1. **Seedling** (種 - tane) - Just planted, beginning to grow
2. **Sapling** (若木 - wakagi) - Young tree finding its strength  
3. **Bamboo** (竹 - take) - Flexible yet strong, rapid growth
4. **Cedar** (杉 - sugi) - Steady, established presence
5. **Ancient Oak** (老木 - rouboku) - Deep roots, mastery

## Craftsman Journey Names
1. **Apprentice** - Learning by observation and copying
2. **Journeyman** - Practicing established techniques
3. **Craftsman** - Developing personal style
4. **Artisan** - Creating with confidence
5. **Master** - Teaching and innovating

## Elements/Nature Progression
1. **Mist** - Formless, seeking shape
2. **Stream** - Finding direction and flow
3. **River** - Powerful and purposeful
4. **Waterfall** - Dramatic transformation
5. **Ocean** - Vast and complete

## Forge/Metal Working Theme
1. **Raw Ore** - Unrefined potential
2. **Heated Steel** - Being shaped and tested
3. **Tempered Blade** - Strengthened through trials
4. **Honed Edge** - Refined and sharp
5. **Legendary Weapon** - Perfectly balanced mastery

1. **Trailhead** - Starting the journey
2. **Foothills** - Building endurance
3. **Ridgeline** - Seeing the bigger picture
4. **Summit Approach** - Final challenges
5. **Peak Master** - Complete overview

Each set captures the progression from beginner to master while adding thematic flavor. The Japanese-inspired names connect directly to shuhari's roots, while the others use metaphors that convey growth, transformation, and mastery in ways that feel more engaging than standard difficulty labels.
