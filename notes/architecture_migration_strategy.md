# Architecture Migration Strategy: From 3-Stage to 7-Stage Shuhari

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the migration strategy from our current 3-stage Shuhari implementation (守破離) to an expanded 7-stage journey that provides more granular progression tracking and better pedagogical scaffolding. This represents not just a technical migration but a fundamental shift in our educational philosophy.

## Philosophical Foundation

### The Original Shuhari (守破離)

The traditional Shuhari represents three macro stages of mastery:
- **守 (Shu)**: "Obey" - Follow the rules precisely
- **破 (Ha)**: "Break" - Start to break and question the rules
- **離 (Ri)**: "Leave" - Transcend the rules, create your own way

This worked well for martial arts where students spent years under direct mentorship. However, in digital education, these stages are too broad. A student might spend months in "Shu" with no visible progress indicators.

### The Expanded 7-Stage Journey

Our new architecture introduces finer granularity while respecting the original philosophy:

1. **初 (Hatsu)**: "Begin" - First exposure, building familiarity
2. **守 (Shu)**: "Obey" - Following patterns, building automaticity
3. **鑑 (Kan)**: "Mirror" - Reflecting patterns, recognizing structures
4. **破 (Ha)**: "Break" - Questioning patterns, exploring variations
5. **問 (Toi)**: "Question" - Deep inquiry, understanding why
6. **離 (Ri)**: "Leave" - Transcending rules, creative application
7. **空 (Ku)**: "Void" - Effortless mastery, teaching others

### Why This Matters

**Pedagogical Benefits:**
- More frequent achievement milestones (7 vs 3)
- Clearer progression feedback
- Better match to cognitive load theory
- Supports both quick wins (Hatsu→Shu) and long-term mastery (Ri→Ku)

**Psychological Benefits:**
- Reduced frustration from being "stuck" in Shu
- More dopamine hits from stage transitions
- Clearer sense of progress
- Better supports different learning speeds
