- add onInput handler to Numpad capture keydown events and update input
- pull session data from localStorage to populate progress bar
    - started on this - still refactoring AI garbage
        - local-session-storage.ts
        - local_db_lookup.ts
        - ProgressBar.tsx
        - SessionProvider.tsx
    - added some new data to Stage in stages.json, so other files may be affected
    - also set up lookup tables in local_db_lookup.ts - a lot of files will probably need to be updated to use this instead of querying the DB
- pre-generate problem sets and organize into difficulty levels
